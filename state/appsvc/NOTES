# notes
{#-
 - these are states for working with services (aka applications)
 - for some there are salt modules for integration, but in some cases REST calls are used
 - these should all be idempotent, (non-idempotent invocations should only live in "MISC.NONIDEMP"
 - the paths include company and product name to disambiguaty product names while keeping the heirarchy shallow. Not ideal for discovery but regarded as a worthwhile measure.
